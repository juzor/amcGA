# Adaptive Mutation Compact Genetic Algorithm

This repository contains the implementation of **Adaptive Mutation Compact Genetic Algorithm (amcGA)**, a compact and efficient approach to solving real-time dynamic optimisation problems. Unlike traditional population-based algorithms, this method is specifically designed for **embedded systems with limited memory**, making it perfect for resource-constrained environments.

## What's Inside?
The classic **compact genetic algorithm (cGA)** is enhanced with three innovative techniques to handle dynamic changes:

1. **Change Detection**  
   - Measures the degree of dynamic change in the environment.  

2. **Adaptive Mutation**  
   - Dynamically adjusts the mutation rate based on the detected degree of change.  

3. **Change Trend Monitoring**  
   - Monitors change patterns to predict and adapt to system dynamics.  

## Why This Matters
If you're dealing with dynamic systems where conditions keep changing—like real-time control systems or adaptive hardware—this approach offers a compact, memory-efficient solution without sacrificing performance.
